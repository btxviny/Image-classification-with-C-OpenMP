## Step 1 Donwload Dataset from LINK ## 
## Step 2 Run init.c to assign random weights to model ##
## Step 3 Convert training labels to one-hot-encoding by running one_hot_encoding.c ##
## Step 4 Run main.c to train the models on 60k pictures from the FMNIST Dataset ##
## Step 5 Validate the Model by running test.c ##
